# Antarctic_Shipwrecks
A map of shipwrecks in the Antarctic between 1578 and 2016. Made in python with Folium from source data at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Antarctic_Shipwrecks_csv/7860956

This notebook takes the source data and maps the locations of shipwrecks, lost vessels, and/or debilitating incidents located in the Antarctic based on the reported latitude and longitude of the incident. The output is an interactive HTML file containing folium markers for each of the shipwrecks.
